> My life, my branding, everything about me as a JSON file.

## tl;dr

I often need some information about myself in apps. I got tired about writing it everytime I need them. That's why I created a JSON with a data set of public available information about my self, my development projects, my career and far more.

## Structure

`docs/life.json` - The resulting JSON of my life
`Swift/*` - A JSON generator written in Swift
