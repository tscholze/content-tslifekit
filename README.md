> My life, my branding, everything about me as a JSON file.

## tl;dr

I often need some information about myself in apps. I got tired about writing it everytime I need them. That's why I created a JSON with a data set of public available information about my self, my development projects, my career and far more.

## Content
All informationin the [`life.json`](docs/life.json) are screened if I want to put them on the public internet. In context of this, there are no direct contact information such as email address or phone numbers. If you want to reach me, please contact me via my social media profiles.

- `persona`: Contains a brief summary of myself
- `socialmedia`: Provides information about my social media accounts
- `curriculumvitae`: A summary of my career and my education like a brief CV
- `contentcreation`: Provides a list of all my content I created to motivate people to tinker around with IT or to educate them about my stuttering and my multiple sclerosis
- `open_source`: Contains a list of all my larger spare time projects, mostly POCs, that I grouped in their technology like "Kotlin/Native on Raspberry Pi"

## Structure

- `docs/life.json` - The resulting JSON of my life
